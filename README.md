I am a dedicated and detail-oriented Software Tester with over 1.3 years of hands-on experience specializing in Manual Testing.
My expertise lies in thoroughly testing software applications to ensure they meet the highest quality standards. 
From the beginning of my career, I have developed a passion for manual testing, which has enabled me to excel in identifying bugs, ensuring functionality, and improving user experience.

My role as an Associate Software QA Engineer at Pearson Sri Lanka provided me with extensive experience in manual testing, where I was responsible for designing and executing detailed test plans and test cases based on comprehensive requirement specifications. I have a keen eye for detail and a methodical approach, which allows me to meticulously analyze software from the user's perspective. Whether it's functional, integration, or usability testing, I am committed to uncovering issues that could impact the end-user experience.
Throughout my career, I have gained significant experience in working closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, product owners, and other stakeholders, to ensure that all aspects of the software are tested thoroughly. My ability to communicate clearly and provide actionable feedback has been a key factor in successfully delivering high-quality software.
In addition to my professional experience, my academic background has further strengthened my technical skills. I hold an MSc in Computer Science from York St John University, UK, and a BSc (Hons) in Information Technology, specializing in Software Engineering, from the Sri Lankan Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT). These qualifications have provided me with a solid foundation in software engineering principles, which I apply rigorously in my testing work.

While I have begun to explore automation testing, my primary passion remains in manual testing, where I find great satisfaction in the hands-on approach of verifying software quality.At the same time, I am eager to expand my knowledge in automation testing. Having already acquired a foundation in automation using Java and C#, I am enthusiastic about integrating automation into my skill set to enhance the efficiency and coverage of my testing efforts.
I am driven by a continuous desire to learn and improve, always seeking new ways to enhance my testing strategies and ensure that the software I work on is not only functional but also user-friendly and reliable.
